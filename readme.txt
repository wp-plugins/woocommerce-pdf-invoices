== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to tell the plugin to show the logo instead of my company name? =

No, there is no need to tell. If you upload your custom company logo, WooCommerce PDF Invoices will use your logo to show on the invoice. If you remove the logo again and save the changes, the company name and optionally the company slogan will be used.

= Can I make a request to add some particular functionality? =

Of course you can! Please open a support thread and I will try to answer as soon as possible. Don't hesitate to contact me for questions.
